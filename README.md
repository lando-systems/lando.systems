lando.systems (vanilla edition)
===============================


Motivation
----------
After spending some time working through different front-end frameworks
(react, preact, vue, next.js, vite, astro/astro-mdx, ...) for a rebuild of 
lando.systems (a website that mostly hosts [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) 
games made by myself and a group of friends over the past decade), 
I got annoyed with how much extra junk came along with building 'modern' 
websites and started searching around for more straightforward methods 
that don't require a whole build system that's harder to understand than 
it should be, and a ton of dependencies that will inevitably become 
outdated, making the site harder to maintain in the long term.

It turns out we're no longer in the dark ages of web development from maybe 
the mid-2000's to around 2020. We pretty much don't need to worry about 
janky inconsistencies between browsers (ðŸ˜’ @ Internet Explorer) and 
much of the modern javascript ecosystem is now supported natively, so 
why not get back to the basics and try building out a version of the 
site that doesn't end up like a giant katamari of javascript and build tools?
